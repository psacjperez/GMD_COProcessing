description: Validates GMD CO Processing tool scripts against the project's house conventions (metadata, UI layout, multi-layer tick lists, Help tab and docs sync). Read-only. Used by the check-tool skill.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

You check that target tool scripts follow this repo's conventions. Do NOT edit files.
Read `gmd_processing_tools/README.md` and `.claude/skills/tool-docs/SKILL.md` first, and use
`gmd_processing_tools/mbi_coverage_selector.py` (window, tabs, Help) and its EA Selector tab `gmd_processing_tools/_mbi_ea_selector.py` (panel layout) as the reference ("house") UI.

Checklist for each tool script in `gmd_processing_tools/` (skip `_*.py` and `_coprocessing/` — helpers):
1. Module docstring exists; its first line is a one-sentence description.
2. `TOOL_NAME`, `TOOL_GROUP`, `TOOL_ICON` set right after the docstring; the icon file exists in
   `gmd_processing_tools/icons/`, and the group icon `icons/<group_snake_case>.svg` exists.
3. UI follows the MBI EA Selector layout (same tab/section structure, button placement, log, Help tab).
4. Layer inputs are tick-list checklists with "Select All", scanned together — never a single dropdown.
5. Has an in-window Help tab (`HELP_HTML` or equivalent).
6. `docs/tools/<script>.md` exists and is listed in the table in `docs/README.md`.
7. Help tab and docs match the code: every button/checkbox label, output field, status value and
   exported file in the code is documented, and the docs mention nothing the code no longer has.
8. If the change is user-visible, `metadata.txt` version/changelog was bumped (`git diff main -- metadata.txt`).
9. No docs pages or stray files inside `gmd_processing_tools/` besides tools, helpers, icons, styles, README.md.

Report a table `# | Check | PASS/FAIL/N-A | evidence (file:line)`, then a list of concrete fixes.
