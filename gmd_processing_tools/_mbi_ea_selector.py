r"""MBI EA Coverage — choose which involved EA covers each MBI gap / overlap.

When the EA MBI Checker finds gaps or overlaps, every discrepancy
(case_uuid) involves two or more EAs — possibly from different EA layers. This window lists
each MBI case with all of its involved EAs. The tick sits on the CASE row: a barangay is
assigned to the MBI and its EA(s) listed below cover it — the EA rows are information only
(right-click an EA row to make that one the only covering EA):

  • Overlap — the covering EA keeps the overlap; the other EAs release (clip) it.
  • Gap     — the covering EA absorbs the gap; the other EAs are not extended.

Workflow:
  Step 1  Select every EA layer the involved areas come from (one or more). EAs are matched
          by 'ea_geocode' across all selected layers.
  Step 2  Optionally pick a building point layer (and its geocode field) to count the
          buildings inside each MBI, and per involved EA the ones tagged to it.
  Step 3  Pick the MBI Results layer — the 'ppp_mbi' layer of the Barangay Selector
          (needs 'case_uuid') — and click Load MBI Cases. No MBI check is run here (the
          Run Check box is hidden): the MBIs were detected in the Barangay Selector.
          A row without a barangay name gets it by its geocode / bgy_geocode from the other
          MBI rows, else from the ticked EA layers.
  Step 4  Tick the Role / Status box ON THE CASE ROW. The EA(s) listed under it cover the
          MBI; untick it to make the case Pending again.
          Shared overlaps: when an overlap runs across several EAs (and their layers are
          selected), ticking the case covers it with ALL of them — each keeps only its own
          part of the overlap (the MBI clipped to that EA, minus what an EA before it keeps,
          largest part first). The case is Partly Covered until those parts fill the MBI.
          Otherwise only one EA can cover a case: the one holding most of the MBI (for a gap,
          the one with most tagged buildings, else the nearest). Right-click an EA row to
          pick another EA, add one to a shared overlap or mark the case pending.
          Auto-Assign Pending: single-EA cases go to that EA, multi-EA cases go to the EA
          owning most of the buildings inside the MBI (needs Step 2); shared overlaps go to
          every EA with tagged buildings, most first.
  Step 5  Apply Coverage writes 'assigned_ea' (covering EA codes, comma-separated),
          'ea_role' (Covers / Releases, per row) and 'coverage_status' (1_Covered /
          2_Not Covered / 3_Partially Covered, per case) into the MBI layer as unsaved,
          undoable edits, and adds the temporary layer 'ppp_mbi_ea_clipped' (same fields as
          ppp_mbi): the covering barangay's row becomes one row per ticked EA, clipped to that
          EA (assigned_ea = that EA, 1_Covered); not-covered rows and leftovers are kept with
          2_Not Covered. An old 'MBI Coverage Parts' layer is
          removed. This tool is the only one that writes the coverage status.
  Step 6  Export GPKG + CSV writes the processed MBI layer, the coverage parts and a decision
          log CSV into the Export folder (applying any pending choices first).

MBIs from the Barangay Selector ('ppp_mbi', has 'assigned_bgy'):
  Picking such a layer ticks "Choose EAs inside the covering barangay". The covering barangay
  chosen there decides which EAs can cover the MBI:
    • Each MBI is listed ONCE PER COVERING BARANGAY (a shared overlap is first clipped to each
      barangay — the MBI ∩ that barangay's EAs, minus what a barangay chosen before it keeps).
    • The EAs offered are only that barangay's EAs (from the ticked EA layers, matched on the
      EA layer's 'geocode', else the start of 'ea_geocode'): for an overlap / disputed area the
      EAs holding part of it (several can share it out), for a gap the EAs within the search
      distance (default 5 m); none that close -> the 3 nearest EAs of the barangay.
    • MBIs with no covering barangay yet, and no-longer-detected MBIs, are skipped.
  Apply writes 'assigned_ea' and 'coverage_status' on the covering barangay's row(s) only;
  rows of barangays not chosen get no EA and 2_Not Covered. The Barangay Selector's
  'assigned_bgy' is never changed (no 'ea_role' in this mode).
