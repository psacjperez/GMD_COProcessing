r"""MBI Barangay Coverage — counter-check the remaining MBIs, then choose the covering barangay.

The remaining MBIs (the gaps / overlaps the PSOs declared pending, e.g. the 'remaining_cases'
layer of GEMMA's MBI Validator GeoPackage, Disputed cases included) are counter-checked with a
fresh run of the built-in MBI Checker (a copy of GEMMA's MBI Checker v13 — GEMMA does not need
to be installed) on the barangay layers:

  • Still detected     — the check still finds the remaining MBI (shares area with it).
  • Newly detected     — the check finds an MBI that is not in the remaining layer
                         (light green row in the preview).
  • No longer detected — a remaining MBI the check does not find any more (nothing to cover).

Every detected MBI involves two or more barangays, possibly from different barangay layers.
The preview lists each MBI with all of its involved barangays, so you can tick the barangay
that covers it:

  • Overlap — the ticked barangay keeps the overlap; the other barangays release (clip) it.
  • Gap     — the ticked barangay absorbs the gap; the other barangays are not extended.

Barangays are matched on the barangay geocode ('geocode' / 'involved_areas' in the MBI layer,
'geocode' / 'bgy_geocode' in the barangay layers). Several EAs of one barangay in an MBI case
count as one barangay.

Workflow:
  Step 1  Pick the Remaining MBI layer (or Browse GPKG… to load 'remaining_cases' from a
          ref_mbi_reviewed GeoPackage).
  Step 2  Select every barangay layer the involved barangays come from (one or more).
  Step 3  Pick the building point layer (and its geocode field): the MBI Checker counts the
          buildings inside each MBI, and per involved barangay the ones tagged to it are
          counted (the field may hold the barangay geocode or an EA geocode that starts with it).
  Step 4  Click Run Check & Counter-Check — runs the built-in MBI Checker on the selected barangay
          layers, compares each detection with the remaining MBIs, adds one "ppp_mbi"
          layer ('detection', 'ref_case_uuid', 'ref_status', 'ref_remarks') and lists its cases.
          Or pick an existing MBI layer (needs 'case_uuid') and click Load MBI Cases.
          'Skip within-barangay cases' leaves out cases that involve a single barangay.
  Step 5  Tick the Role / Status box of the covering barangay in each case.
          Shared overlaps: when an overlap runs across several barangays (and their layers
          are selected), more than one barangay can be ticked — each keeps only its own part
          of the overlap (the MBI clipped to that barangay, minus what a barangay ticked
          before it keeps). The case is Partly Covered until those parts fill the MBI.
          Auto-Assign Pending: single-barangay cases go to that barangay, multi-barangay
          cases go to the barangay owning most of the buildings inside the MBI (needs
          Step 3); shared overlaps go to every barangay with tagged buildings, most first.
          No-longer-detected MBIs have nothing to cover and cannot be ticked.
  Step 6  Apply Coverage writes 'assigned_bgy' (covering barangay geocodes, comma-separated)
          into the MBI layer. No coverage status is written here — the MBI EA Selector writes
          it. Unsaved, undoable edits; no-longer-detected MBIs are untouched.
          An MBI between TWO barangays goes to one of them (ticking one unticks the other);
          only an overlap across THREE OR MORE barangays can be shared out (several ticks).
  Step 7  Join MBI to Barangays makes a 'Barangays + MBI' layer: the ticked barangay layers with
          every kept MBI part added as its own feature carrying the covering barangay's attributes,
          flagged 'bgy_part' = 'MBI' / 'is_mbi' = 1 and drawn hatched magenta (kept parts are cut
          out of the barangay features, so released overlaps leave the other barangays).
  Step 8  Export GPKG + CSV writes the processed MBI layer, the coverage parts, the joined
          barangays and a decision log CSV into the Export folder (applying pending choices first).
  Step 9  Choose EAs in MBI EA Selector… applies pending choices and opens the MBI EA Selector
          with this layer in barangay mode: each MBI is listed under its covering barangay
          ('assigned_bgy') and only that barangay's EAs can be chosen to cover it.

# barangays > 0.10 m², involved = polygons within 0.50 m; mbi_level from region / province /
# city / barangay; one row per finding, output in EPSG:4326) is unchanged. Adjusted for the
# counter-check:
#   • Disputed Areas are reported again (mbi_type 3_Disputed): polygons whose 'boundary' is
#     'Contested'. Their involved barangays are the contested polygon plus every polygon
#     within 0.50 m, so a covering barangay can be chosen. As in GEMMA, their footprint is
#     subtracted from the gaps.
#   • Reference MBI cases are NOT subtracted from the gaps (GEMMA auto-detects any loaded
#     layer with 'mbi_type' and drops its Disputed footprints) — that would hide the very
#     remaining Disputed MBIs being counter-checked.
#   • Building points are optional (counts are 0 without them).
#   • Slivers: a finding of 0.10 m² or less is dropped only when no building point is inside
#     (GEMMA drops it regardless) — same rule as the National-Level and EA MBI Checkers, and
#     measured the same way as their $area (project ellipsoid; planar EPSG:3857 if none).

  <h3 style="color:#111827; font-size:14px; border-bottom:1px solid #e5e7eb; padding-bottom:4px;">Quick Start</h3>
  <ol style="margin-top:4px;">
    <li><b>Pick the remaining MBI layer</b> (left, <i>Remaining MBI Layer</i>). Not loaded yet? Click the folder
        button (<b>Browse GPKG…</b>) and open the MBI Validator's <i>ref_mbi_reviewed-….gpkg</i> — its
        <i>remaining_cases</i> layer is added and picked for you.</li>
    <li><b>Tick your barangay layers</b> (<i>Barangay Layers</i>) — every layer the involved barangays come from.</li>
    <li>Pick the <i>Building Points</i> layer so the check counts the buildings inside each MBI.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Run Check &amp; Counter-Check</b> (the <b style="color:#E65100;">orange</b> box). The MBI Checker
        runs on the barangay layers and every MBI it finds is compared with the remaining MBIs, Disputed ones
        included.</li>
    <li>Read the <b>Detection</b> column: <b>Still detected</b>, <b>Newly detected</b> (the whole row is
        <b style="color:#558b2f;">light green</b>), <b>No longer detected</b> (grey, nothing to cover) or
        <b>Not checked</b> (blue-grey cell: its MBI type was not looked for in this run — still to be covered).</li>
    <li>In the list, <b>tick the Role / Status box of the barangay that covers</b> each detected MBI — or click
        <b>Auto-Assign Pending</b> to let the tool decide the easy ones, then review. An overlap that
        runs across several barangays can be <b>shared out</b>: tick more than one barangay and each keeps only
        its own part (see <i>Shared Overlaps</i> below).</li>
    <li>Click <b>Apply Coverage</b> to write your choices into the <i>ppp_mbi</i> layer: the chosen barangay's row
        gets the covering barangay geocode in <i>assigned_bgy</i>. No coverage status is written here — the MBI EA
        Selector writes it.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Join MBI to Barangays</b> for a copy of the barangay layers with each MBI joined to the barangay
        it is assigned to — the joined MBI parts are drawn <b style="color:#c51162;">hatched magenta</b> and flagged
        <i>bgy_part</i> = <b>MBI</b> / <i>is_mbi</i> = <b>1</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Export GPKG + CSV</b> to save the processed layer and a decision log.</li>
    <li><b>Next step — choose the EA:</b> click <b>Choose EAs in MBI EA Selector…</b>. It applies any pending
        choices, then opens the MBI EA Selector with this layer: every MBI is listed under the barangay you chose
        here and <b>only that barangay's EAs</b> are offered. Tick the EA layers there and click <b>Load MBI
        Cases</b>.</li>

    The MBI EA Selector reads <i>assigned_bgy</i> from this layer (keep the Coverage field named
    <i>assigned_bgy</i>). A shared overlap is listed there once per covering barangay, each with only its part.
    MBIs still pending here are skipped there, so assign them first. It writes <i>assigned_ea</i> and
    <i>coverage_status</i> on the covering barangay's rows and never changes <i>assigned_bgy</i>.

    Ticking barangays only changes the viewer. <i>Apply Coverage</i> writes into the MBI layer inside an
    ordinary QGIS edit session — keep it with Toggle Editing's <b>Save Edits</b>, or undo with
    <b>Edit &gt; Undo</b> / <b>Discard Edits</b>. The remaining MBI layer and the barangay layers are never

        Run the mode that covers its type to counter-check it as well. When the remaining layer carries

        <td>Same as GEMMA's MBI Validator: a detection and a remaining MBI only match when they overlap in <b>area</b>;
        merely touching along an edge does not count, so a genuinely new MBI next to an old one is reported as new.

        <b>gaps</b> are holes between the dissolved barangays, involving every barangay within 0.50 m
        (<i>1_Gap</i>); the MBI level comes from region / province / city / barangay. A finding of
        <b>0.10 m² or less with no building point inside</b> is dropped as a sliver; a tiny one holding a building
        is kept. This area is measured on the project's ellipsoid (as QGIS <i>$area</i>, like the National-Level
        and EA MBI Checkers), or planar in EPSG:3857 when the project has no ellipsoid. Adjusted for the counter-check:
        <b>disputed areas</b> are reported again (<i>3_Disputed</i>: polygons whose <i>boundary</i> is
        <i>Contested</i>, involving the contested polygon and every barangay within 0.50 m, so a covering barangay can
        be chosen; their footprint is left out of the gaps, as in GEMMA); the remaining MBIs are <b>not</b> subtracted
        from the gaps (GEMMA drops loaded Disputed cases from its gaps, which would hide the cases being checked); and

        written as <b>one row per involved barangay</b>, all sharing the MBI's <i>case_uuid</i> and geometry, as in the
        MBI EA Selector: <i>geocode, region, province, city_mun, barangay</i> are that row's barangay, so every row
        gets its own coverage status. Fields: the MBI Checker's (<i>case_uuid, geocode … involved_areas,
