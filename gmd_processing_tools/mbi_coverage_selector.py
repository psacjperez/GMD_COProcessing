r"""MBI Coverage Selector — choose the barangay, then the EA, that covers each MBI.

One window with three tabs:

  • Barangay Selector     — counter-check the MBI layer against the remaining MBIs, then
                            tick the barangay that covers each gap / overlap / disputed area
                            and write it as 'assigned_bgy' (tab code: _mbi_bgy_selector.py).
  • EA Selector           — list each MBI under its covering barangay and choose which EA of
                            that barangay covers it; writes 'assigned_ea' and
                            'coverage_status' (tab code: _mbi_ea_selector.py).
  • Help and Information  — how both tabs work, step by step.

Workflow:
  Step 1  Barangay Selector: pick the Remaining MBI layer, the MBI Layer, the Building Points
          and the barangay layers, then click Load MBI Cases (the MBI layer is counter-checked
          against the remaining MBIs and a 'ppp_mbi' layer is added).
  Step 2  Tick the covering barangay of each case, then Apply Coverage ('assigned_bgy').
  Step 3  Click "Choose EAs in the EA Selector Tab →": the window switches to the EA Selector
          tab with the same MBI layer (and building points) already picked.
  Step 4  EA Selector: tick the EA layers of the covering barangays and click Load MBI Cases.
  Step 5  Tick each case row (its EA(s) cover the MBI), then Apply Coverage
          ('assigned_ea', 'coverage_status') and Export GPKG + CSV.

Closing or minimizing the window keeps the work of both tabs: open the tool again to resume
(until QGIS is closed). Nothing is saved to disk until Export, and Apply Coverage writes into
the MBI layer as ordinary, undoable QGIS edits.

        the folder button (<b>Browse GPKG…</b>) and open the MBI Validator's <i>ref_mbi_reviewed-….gpkg</i>: its
        <i>remaining_cases</i> layer is added and picked for you.</li>
    <li><b>Pick the MBI Layer</b> — the MBIs to counter-check and cover (e.g. a National-Level MBI Checker result;
        it needs <i>case_uuid</i>).</li>
    <li>Pick the <b>Building Points</b> layer (and its <i>Geocode field</i>) so each case and barangay shows its
        building count.</li>
    <li><b>Tick your Barangay Layers</b> — every layer the involved barangays come from.</li>
    <li>Click <b style="color:#2e7d32;">Load MBI Cases</b> (green). Every MBI of the MBI Layer is compared with the
        remaining MBIs, Disputed ones included; a <i>ppp_mbi</i> layer with the result is added and its cases are
        listed.</li>
    <li>Read the <b>Detection</b> column: <b>Still detected</b>, <b>Newly detected</b> (the whole row is
        <b style="color:#558b2f;">light green</b>), <b>No longer detected</b> (grey, nothing to cover) or
        <b>Not checked</b> (blue-grey cell: the MBI Layer has no MBI of its type — still to be covered).</li>
    <li>In the list, <b>tick the Role / Status box of the barangay that covers</b> each MBI. An overlap that runs
        across three or more barangays can be <b>shared out</b>: tick more than one barangay and each keeps only its
        own part (see <i>Shared Overlaps</i> below).</li>
    <li>Click <b>Apply Coverage</b> to write your choices into the <i>ppp_mbi</i> layer (<i>assigned_bgy</i>).
        No coverage status is written here — the EA Selector writes it.</li>
